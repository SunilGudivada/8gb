ok
but for Free plan
if i select FRee then
SUNIL (2:55 PM):
for free plan also it will go to payment gate way with 0 charges

logic ll diferent for free
for FREE it will direct go to step-3 with Zero
and allow to Add new Advertisement
SUNIL (2:56 PM):
i have seen few websites where it redirect to payment gateway with 0 charges
that will be usefull for security reasons
anyone can create a bot and add number of posts with free ass
add
LAPI (2:57 PM):
exactly. but here after post an ad it will go for Admin approval and once admin approve then only it will show to public search
SUNIL (2:57 PM):
yes
LAPI (2:58 PM):
so make it like For FREE plan then it will direct go to step 3
or next to payment gateway
SUNIL (2:58 PM):
anyway whether it is free or pais ad admin should approve
LAPI (2:58 PM):
yes
SUNIL (2:59 PM):
step 3 is confirmation message after payment

LAPI (3:16 PM):
so instantly we will generate from our admin adn we ll make a cross check
its simple logic
SUNIL (3:16 PM):
okay
that needs server thats why 
can you send me filezilla credentials that would be easy for me 
not required 
wait 
LAPI (3:18 PM):
1. redirect to payment gateway
2. If successful then store the amount and transactioon ID with User name & ID
3. Store the same in database and reflect in admin
SUNIL (3:18 PM):
okay
LAPI (3:18 PM):
make a status of every transaction for cross check
SUNIL (3:18 PM):
okay 
LAPI (3:18 PM):
and display a card in dashboard as todays transaction
 
SUNIL (3:19 PM):
okay
LAPI (3:20 PM):
After post an Ad it will make Invoice and mail and download the same
SUNIL (3:20 PM):
yes
all that requires server thats why i have not yet started
LAPI (3:20 PM):
in admin panel add GSTIN, and 18% with company details so that it will reflect in invoice
you need server fto access and Database access ?
i will generate and share asap
SUNIL (3:21 PM):
you have shared me cpanel credentials na
